Authors: Abby Pitcairn, Ben Sweeney, Esther Mugish, Jere Parisic

INSTRUCTIONS:
To run, create a new project in your preferred Java IDE. Import/Copy Fraction.java, FractionMain.java, and INumber.java to that project. The
available test methods are implemented with comments. Unavailable test methods are empty.

By default, the program is set to create and print a 100-item array of Fraction objects, as well as find the minimum and maximum fractions.
Change any desired parameters in the main method and call any desired test methods. Some test method examples are included and are currently
commented out.
